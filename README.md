# ContactManagerCLI
We will be building a command line application for keeping track of "contacts". A contact will be comprised of a a name and phone number combination.

The application should be able to:

Show all your contacts
Add a new contact
Search a contact by her name
Delete an existing contact
The application should keep its data in a file named contacts.txt so that the information persists between runs of the application.
